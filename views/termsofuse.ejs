              engage respectfully and responsibly, ensuring fair usage for all.

            <h3>Vendor Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
              While Utsav Universe brings you a network of trusted vendors, we
              serve as a facilitator and not a direct party to any agreements
              between users and vendors. We work tirelessly to feature reliable
              and verified service providers, but it is essential that users
              independently review and finalize terms with vendors to ensure the
              best experience. Our aim is to connect you with the best resources
              to make your celebrations truly exceptional.
